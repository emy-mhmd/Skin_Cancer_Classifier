# Skin Cancer Classification using Transfer Learning and Handcrafted CNN  

This repository contains the implementation of a skin cancer binary classification project using transfer learning models and a handcrafted CNN. The models are designed to classify images as either benign or malignant with high accuracy. Additionally, the project includes a user-friendly web application that allows users to upload skin lesion images and select a model for predictions, providing a confidence percentage for each result.

### Key Features:  
- **Pre-Trained Models**: Implementations of ResNet50, EfficientNetB5, MobileNetV2, and VGG16, trained on the ISIC dataset for binary classification.  
- **Handcrafted CNN**: A custom-designed convolutional neural network inspired by VGG16 architecture, achieving an accuracy of 87%.  
- **Ensemble Approach**: Combines predictions from all models to improve overall accuracy and robustness.  
- **Web Interface**: A simple and interactive web application for model selection and image classification, making AI-assisted diagnostics accessible.  
- **Visualization Tools**: Confusion matrices, ROC curves, and loss/accuracy graphs to evaluate model performance.
