# Self-Driving Car – Behavioral Cloning 

This project implements a deep learning model that learns to steer a car by observing human driving behavior. The model processes images from a front-facing camera and predicts steering angles, effectively cloning human driving behavior.

##  Key Features

- **Data Augmentation**: Robust techniques for better generalization
- **CNN Architecture**: Custom network inspired by NVIDIA's self-driving car model
- **Real-time Prediction**: Socket.IO server for live steering angle predictions
- **Data Balancing**: Prevents model bias toward straight driving
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Optimized image preprocessing for better model performance

##  Model Architecture

The network is based on NVIDIA's self-driving car architecture with modifications:

```
Input: (66, 200, 3) preprocessed image
    ↓
Conv2D (24 filters, 5x5, strides=2x2) + ELU
    ↓
Conv2D (36 filters, 5x5, strides=2x2) + ELU
    ↓
Conv2D (48 filters, 5x5, strides=2x2) + ELU
    ↓
Conv2D (64 filters, 3x3) + ELU
    ↓
Conv2D (64 filters, 3x3) + ELU
    ↓
Flatten
    ↓
Dense (100 neurons) + ELU
    ↓
Dense (50 neurons) + ELU
    ↓
Dense (10 neurons) + ELU
    ↓
Output: 1 neuron (steering angle)
```

##  Installation & Usage

###  Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- OpenCV
- Flask, SocketIO, Eventlet
- Pandas, scikit-learn, imgaug

###  Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/self-driving-car.git
cd self-driving-car
pip install tensorflow opencv-python socketio eventlet flask pandas scikit-learn imgaug
```

###  Training the Model

1. Place your training data inside the `data/` folder containing:
   - `IMG/` directory (images)
   - `driving_log.csv`

2. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

3. The trained model will be saved as `model.h5`

###  Running the Prediction Server

Start the server for real-time steering predictions:

```bash
python test.py
```

- Runs on port 4567
- Waits for connections from the driving simulator

##  Technical Details

###  Data Preprocessing

- Crop images to focus on the road area
- Convert RGB → YUV color space
- Apply Gaussian blur for noise reduction
- Resize images to 200×66 pixels
- Normalize pixel values (scale 0–1)

###  Data Augmentation

- Random panning and shifting
- Zoom variations
- Brightness adjustments
- Horizontal flipping (with steering angle correction)
- Random blurring
- Rotation transformations

###  Training Approach

- Balanced dataset to avoid steering bias
- 80/20 train-validation split
- Batch generator for efficient training
- **Loss function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- **Optimizer**: Adam (learning rate = 1e-6)

---

##  Results

-  Low validation loss → strong generalization
-  Smooth steering predictions under varied conditions
-  Stable performance due to diverse augmentations
